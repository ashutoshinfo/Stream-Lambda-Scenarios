Description:

This method takes a list of Employee objects and performs parallel processing to count occurrences of each Employee. 
It returns a ConcurrentMap where each key is an Employee and the corresponding value is the count of its occurrences in the input list. 
The method uses Java streams and collectors to achieve this.

After collecting the initial counts using Collectors.groupingByConcurrent,
the method filters out entries where the count is not greater than 1 using the .filter(entry -> entry.getValue() > 1) operation. 
Only the entries with a count greater than 1 are further processed.

The final result is a filtered ConcurrentMap containing only those Employee instances that occur more than once in the input list,
 along with their corresponding counts of occurrences.
